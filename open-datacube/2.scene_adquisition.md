# Add Data to the Datacube

Adding data (images) to the datacbe consists of telling the datacube where we have images in our file system. Then, it will be able to obtain information about the images including its location to create search indexes in the database and facilitate subsequent queries.

## Selecting Scenes

Landsat satellites collect pictures of earth called scenes. Colombia is covered by aproximately 86 scenes of landsat as depicted bellow. The yellow squares represent the scenes and red squares are called tiles.

Each yellow square is labeled using the **path-row** notation. This notation allow user reference any landsat scene specifiying the PATH and ROW numbers. We can obtain scenes based on this notation using the [EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/), this viewer require you to be registered. We will request scenes from 01/01/2016 to 12/31/2018 for the PATH=5 and ROW=57. This scene cover part of Vichada Deparment in Colombia.

The next step is the selection of the Scene Collection (Dataset). We will use the Landsat Collection 1 - Level-1. Each level of the landsat collection perform some image correction inteded for different analysis. In particular, Level-2 performs Surface Reflectance Correction to mitigate atmospheric effects over images (scenes). Further information about Landsat Collection Levels can be found in [3].

After the Landsat Collection seleciton, we will get the scenes that match the criteria specified before. We have to select each scene we are interested in. A click on the **shopping cart icon** will select the scene to be downloaded.  The image icon will display a preview of the scene on the map. After selecting the images you need you must use the button **View Item Basket** to request the scenes. This request order will take several minutes since images are preprocessed (image correction) on-demand.

You will receive and email on which the EarthExplorer platform will confirm the reception of your order, i.e., your request is in a queue waiting for being processed. A link may be available to track the status of your order.

Once the order starts being processed, another email will be sent.

So you can check the status of your order using the link provided in the email.

Another email will be sent when the processing is completed and requested scenes are ready to be downloaded. Open the link.

## Scenes in General and Landsat Collection 1 Level-2 (On-Demand)

Scenes have unique idenifiers that provide relevant information about the satellite from which they were taken and other relevant data about the scene, for example: **LC08_L1GT_029030_20151209_20160131_01_RT**, further informatio about this naming convention in [9].
As ordered scenes are atmospherically corrected, the resulting ones are compressed in tar.gz file with a different naming convention as depicted below.

For Example: LC080030572019050401T1-SC20190909195339

* L = Landsat
* C = Sensor (“C”=OLI/TIRS combined, “O”=OLI-only, “T”=TIRS-only, “E”=ETM+, “T”=“TM, “M”=MSS)
* 08 = Satellite (”07”=Landsat 7, “08”=Landsat 8)
* 003 = WRS path
* 057 = WRS row
* 20190504 = Acquisition date year, month, day (2019/05/04)
* 01 = Collection number (01, 02, …)
* T1 = Collection category (“RT”=Real-Time, “T1”=Tier 1, “T2”=Tier 2)

Probably this part is related with the day the scene was processed for atmosphericall correction.

* SC = Unknown (information about this have to be verified on internet)
* 20190909195339 = Processing year, month, day, hour, min, sec (2019/09/09 - 19:53:39)
