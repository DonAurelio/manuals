# Product Creation

The datacube needs to know about the properies of the scenes produced for every satellite we are interested in. As every satellite takes different **measuremets**, then every image will have different data. The datacube needs to care about organizing data of images from the same satellite together. For each satellite a **Product** must be created in the datacube. Then scenes from the same satellite corresponds with the same datacube Product. 


Start the container created in the Fist section or run the following preconfigured container. If you use the second option you have to create the directory *datacube_shared*. 

```sh 
mkdir datacube_shared
cd datacube_shared
```

Run the container

```sh 
docker run \
	-it \
	--name mycube \
	-e DATACUBE_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/custom-config.conf \
	-e DB_DATABASE=datacube  \
	-e DB_HOSTNAME=localhost \
	-e DB_USERNAME=cube  \
	-e DB_PASSWORD=cube  \
	-e DB_PORT=5432 \
	-v ${PWD}:/datacube_shared \
	donaurelio/opendatacube:1.6.1-base \
	bash
```

Once you are within the container use `sudo su cube` to change to **cubo** user 

```sh 
sudo su cubo
cd 
```

## Create Source Storage and Datacube Storage

We wil organize the data (scenes) we want to index in the datacube in the **/source_storage**. The data indexed and ingested by the datacube will be placed in **/dc_storage** autimatically by the datacube.

```sh 
sudo mkdir /dc_storage /source_storage
sudo chown cubo:root /dc_storage /source_storage
```

## Data Indexing and Ingestion


To organize data of the same satellite in the datacube we will create a **product**. To do this we need a *Product Definition File*.
