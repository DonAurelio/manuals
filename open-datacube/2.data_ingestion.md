# Add Data to the Datacube

Adding data (images) to the datacbe consists of telling the datacube where we have images in our file system. Then, it will be able to obtain information about the images including its location to create search indexes in the database and facilitate subsequent queries.

## Selecting Scenes

Landsat satellites collect pictures of earth called scenes. Colombia is covered by aproximately 86 scenes of landsat as depicted bellow. The yellow squares represent the scenes and red squares are called tiles.

Each yellow square is labeled using the **path-row** notation. This notation allow user reference any landsat scene specifiying the PATH and ROW numbers. We can obtain scenes based on this notation using the [EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). This viewer require you to be registered.
